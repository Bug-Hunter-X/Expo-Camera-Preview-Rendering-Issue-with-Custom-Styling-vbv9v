This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera component where the preview fails to render correctly when custom styling is applied, specifically within flexbox layouts. The issue is intermittent and appears to be related to how Expo handles the camera preview's dimensions and aspect ratio in conjunction with flexbox.  The bugSolution.js file provides a workaround.
